# Description

This course provides a **practical introduction to producing figures for use in reports and publications**.

It is a wide ranging course which looks at **how to design figures to clearly and fairly represent your data**, with the aim of conveying information in an effective manner. It draws on **principles of visual design** and provides strategies to make informed choices of **figure elements and composition**, and to facilitate the communication of complex results. The course also covers the **practical aspects of compositing and editing of final figures** and the allowable manipulation of bitmap images.

The course introduces the use of different open source software packages for editing images to achieve professional quality and is illustrated with example figures adapted from common analysis tools.

**Please note:** *The material provided in this course is partially based on the course [Introduction to Scientific Figure Design](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/training.html#figuredesign), provided by Babraham Bioinformatics.*
